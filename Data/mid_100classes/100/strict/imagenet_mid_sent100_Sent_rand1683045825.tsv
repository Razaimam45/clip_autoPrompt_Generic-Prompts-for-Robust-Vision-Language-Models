hen	 hosts butch richenback and john stephens both former world champions lead you . people should not be intimidated when they are learning how to blow a duck call because they are not going to learn not going to get better if they do get that call out and practice petty says . learning what your partner is capable of doing and then making the most of your combined skills takes time and patience . there are days when we try everything in the screeching loud hail calls soft calls no calls . when the ducks are way out there you can be more aggressive and louder cullum says . you want to sound realistic just like mallard hens . but you can still be aggressive and snappy even when they close just by toning it volume down . sometimes you call even when you do see ducks because down in those trees you ca see far away . and you and your partner have really got to stay on them when you calling in a field . when you get in those situations you can use a pintail or wigeon whistle or do a fast teal call . ducks are used to hearing a lot of sounds and when you can do that it convincing . the exception is a windy day when i think the more callers the better . this is then a multiple learning experience 
hen	 when two people are calling and you are working as a team one can be calling like one or two different ducks and the other can be calling another way . when we are calling together i listen to what he i try to do something opposite to sound like more ducks . if he doing a lazy hen then i might be doing a coarse hen or a bouncin hen . both cullum and curtis after spending countless hours listening to live ducks say they have categorized four types of sounds generated by mallard hens . there what we call a fine hen who hardly opens her throat and whose call tapers off at the end . and a coarse hen which will open her throat more wide open . a lazy hen will drag out the notes . and the bouncin hen she hit a couple of notes and then just bounce it all the way to the bottom excited cullum says . primos and his cohorts observe a few basic rules when working together trying to pull ducks to their decoys . he knows right then they need a certain call . then we key into the birds feeding off what he is doing . if you watch and listen to ducks on the water one old hen is doing most of the work 
hen	 can maximize their reproductive success by having numerous young when conditions are favorable so that at least some will survive . when conditions are poor these same species reduce reproductive output by either choosing not to breed that year or by limiting their breeding attempts . their drab plumage has been genetically shaped over many years allowing hens to blend with the grasses and sedges where they place their nests so that they are less conspicuous to predators . the overall strategy is to get as many eggs out there as they can when conditions are good in the hopes that at least some will make it . experiments with several species of animals have documented that when looking for food individuals choose situations that provide the highest probability for reward and that they are able to learn from past and present experiences . in contrast when mice and vole populations are low predators may become more focused on duck nests 
hen	 many of us are familiar with the squealing call the female wood duck makes when it is disturbed . as a hen sits on her nest incubating her eggs she exposes the embryos to her maternal call . the ability of the ducklings to recognize and respond to the hen call is essential to their survival during this vulnerable period in their life cycle . the first crucial test of their hearing and recognition the female calls to her young encouraging them to follow her to food and water occurs when the ducklings leave their nest . after leaving the nest it is imperative that the hen keep in contact with her young . a series of assembly and maternal calls from the hen and responding vocalizations from the ducklings keep the family unit together . poised to protect her brood the ever watchful hen alerts her young to predators by using an alarm call to which the ducklings instinctively respond most commonly by freezing their movements . for example when a female mallard is sitting on a pond and spots other mallards flying overhead she will typically hail them by projecting a loud familiar hail call that encourages them to join her . additionally vocalization is used to coordinate flight when preparing for migration leaving a roost for feeding grounds or escaping predators . once established pair bonds are reinforced through vocalizations between the drake and hen . canada geese can be heard clearly from a distance when challenging an intruder . predator presence is an important factor in determining a nesting site because the hen is vulnerable during incubation and the young are highly susceptible to predation while on the journey from the nest to water 
hen	 decoys have become almost photolike in their paint schemes but hens especially are colored the way they are so they blend into their surroundings . this does help when you trying to draw ducks from long distance . nemecek continues i talked to biologists who fly aerial waterfowl surveys and they told me the first thing they notice when they see ducks on the water is their black profiles . then the next thing the biologists tell me they see is white so i always set two to three pintail drakes in my spread . i think when ducks get in close detail can make a difference . i always like to have a hen mallard closest to my calling location . when i working ducks i call until it time to shoot . i do quit calling when they head in my direction . i feel that too many hunters lose birds attention when they quit calling 
hen	for ducks the overall strategy is to get as many eggs out there as possible when conditions are good did you ever wonder why some species have a lot of offspring and provide only limited care for their young while others have few offspring and provide intensive care these differences in reproductive strategies have been the object of scientific investigation and debate for years . can maximize their reproductive success by having numerous young when conditions are favorable so that at least some will survive . when conditions are poor these same species reduce reproductive output by either choosing not to breed that year or by limiting their breeding attempts . their drab plumage has been genetically shaped over many years allowing hens to blend with the grasses and sedges where they place their nests so that they are less conspicuous to predators . the overall strategy is to get as many eggs out there as they can when conditions are good in the hopes that at least some will make of like the approach to bag a teal with a shotgun during the hunting season throw out as many pellets as you can and hope that several will hit their mark not recommended 
hen	 certainly that points to how important the milk river ridge would be when it wet and prime says miller . it so far south in alberta that it would be the first habitat that they encounter when coming from the south . in fact several of our hens equipped with satellite transmitters have used the milk river ridge during the course of the research project . when they do touch down they receive a warm welcome . as a result of their habitat preferences and their early return to nesting grounds in the spring pintail hens often establish nests in crop stubble where they and their nests are at great risk of destruction by farm equipment . if a pintail nest and eggs are destroyed the hen may try to renest once or twice but that it 
hen	 any one of these methods will enable you to produce a sound that is somewhere in the vicinity of that of a hen mallard . in most cases these differences are too subtle to make much difference but in some situations such as in a high wind when you want to get as much volume as you can acrylics are hard to beat . hood recalls when i was taught by butch richenback several years ago he told me that one call will do it all . hood adds when you are hunting open water you want a call that produces sound that is not only loud but also travels quickly . if you think of sound waves as ripples on a pond working ducks generally respond to the outside edge of the sound and then work in toward the source of the calling hood says . when you use a softer call the sound waves move slower echo less and are much easier for ducks to follow . my advice is to try out as many calls as you can and then pick the one that just feels right to you 
hen	when it comes to calling tactics it no surprise that call makers have some strong opinions . when i hunt i try to sound like four different ducks . these include a very young hen on the high end a real coarse old hen on the low end and two hens that fall in between the two on the scale . i usually bring along an acrylic call for when i need a lot of volume and a few calls for close working ducks . a very effective tactic is to leave the hole open and give a nonchalant hail call then close the hole with your hand and immediately follow up with a faster call . guys should worry about knowing 30 different types of calls when they really need only three 
hen	 one such time is when you are a passenger on an airplane . another is when you are taken in a small boat on north america largest river in january . when the river is falling waterfowl like to loaf on the edges of sandbars and islands along the main channel byrd says unwrapping a decoy weight . the ducks typically feed in flooded oak flats or grainfields then fly back to the river to rest where they wo be disturbed . several hen mallards chime in somewhere in the watery darkness and the howls of a rowdy band of barred owls erupt from the adjacent forest 
hen	 when the prairies were wet in prime condition and covered with spring wetlands pintail numbers were high . but when drier times occurred and fewer spring wetlands existed pintail numbers were low . this pattern is due to the unique nature of pintails their numbers can boom when conditions are right . all this allows a hen pintail to produce ducklings in about nine weeks compared to about 11 weeks needed by a mallard hen . when pintails are displaced farther north it is generally believed that their production is reduced because fewer females attempt to nest . because of the unique nature of pintails spring ponds are very important in attracting hens to settle and nest in an area as well as providing a superb food source . the end result is that even when they do contain water they are far less productive for pintails than they were historically 
scorpion	scorpion scorpions have been wielding toxic weapons for nearly 400 million years . its segmented tail is the scorpion ultimate weapon . a pair of glands inside the tail pumps venom through the telson or stinger when the scorpion strikes . scorpion venom can include several different types of neurotoxins which shut down the victim nervous system . some scorpions are designed to cripple a single type of prey . scorpions actually rely on their claws to capture most prey resorting to their stinger only if the animal is too strong to overpower 
scorpion	 we were only able to find two instances of period or tergiant inverted animals after the wreath meeting both of which used scorpions . there is a tergiant inverted scorpion as the crest of sir william c . this crest is a very unusual depiction of the sherrington scorpion in the town of lacock where the sherrington family was granted the old abbey as a home by henry viii there are period displays of their armory in the home and in the town church and the scorpion seems always to be in the default tergiant posture . 215 gives the arms of cole argent a cheueron gules betweene three scorpions reversed sable . the emblazon shows the scorpions in what the sca would call the tergiant inverted posture . the combination of a emblazon of a crest with a slightly emblazon of armory is not clear evidence of period practices for scorpions and is certainly not compelling evidence for a general period use of the posture tergiant inverted 
black widow, Latrodectus mactans	 the one good thing that can be said about black widow bite is that once recovered there are usually no after effects . however black widows have a few enemies in the spider world . in my shed just north of the insect garden the usual habitat for black widows has been taken over by a spider physocyclus enaulus of the haplogyne family pholcidae a species that is araneophagic eats other spiders and preys on young black widows among others . few black widows are found where physocyclus sets up house keeping . it also is a killer of young black widows and unfortunately many other spiders as well 
wolf spider, hunting spider	wolf spiders and fisher spiders are the largest and also among the most common of the spiders found in iowa . wolf spiders and fisher spiders have good vision and actively hunt and pursue prey during the day . wolf spiders are common in almost all terrestrial habitats but are usually found in areas of shrubs or tall grass where a plentiful insect supply is available . wolf spider mothers carry their large egg sacs around with them . wolf spiders and fisher spiders are not poisonous though as with all spiders bites may cause reactions in certain individuals . for what it is worth the golden guide spiders and their kin says that wolf spiders make nice pets . water must be provided to wolf spiders kept in captivity

goose	in this era of booming canada goose populations it hard to imagine that just more than 50 years ago the birds were a rarity across much of north america . in fact the giant canada goose which historically nested throughout the upper mississippi river valley was believed to be extinct and many other canada goose populations had been reduced to perilously low levels . fish and wildlife service usfws estimated that the mississippi valley canada goose population alone had a fall flight of nearly 1 . the canada goose branta canadensis is among the most successful and genetically diverse of the world waterfowl . they range in size from the cackling canada goose b . canadensis minima which is slightly larger than a mallard to the giant canada goose b . most canada goose populations are presently thriving and more of the birds likely exist in north america today than at any other time in history . in recent decades some canada goose populations have suffered sharp declines while others remain below optimal management levels . the following is an overview of the status of canada goose populations by flyway compiled from surveys conducted by the usfws canadian wildlife service and cooperating state and provincial wildlife agencies . the atlantic flywaythe birthplace of north america waterfowling tradition the atlantic flyway is home to two large migratory populations of the interior canada goose subspecies b . by 1995 breeding pair counts in northern quebec had declined by 75 percent since the time that surveys were initiated in 1987 forcing waterfowl managers to close the general canada goose season throughout the atlantic flyway states . the sjbp is among the few canada goose populations that have remained persistently below management goals and restrictive harvest regulations for the birds have been in place since the early 1990s 
goose	 the population status of these different subspecies varies and many of the birds share the same migration and wintering areas making canada goose harvest management in the pacific flyway far more challenging than in other regions . in 2000 the usfws estimated the fall cackling canada goose population to be roughly birds similar to the 1999 estimate . the aleutian canada goose named for its breeding grounds in alaska aleutian island chain has also staged an impressive comeback in recent decades . this small canada goose was driven to the brink of extinction earlier this century when foxes were introduced to the aleutian islands . following the stunning success of these recovery efforts the usfws has removed the aleutian canada goose from the federal threatened species list . the pacific flyway other two small canada goose subspecies lesser and taverner canada geese breed throughout the north slope and the interior of alaska and largely winter in washington and oregon . the much larger dusky canada goose weighing from eight to 10 pounds is named for its dark body plumage varying among individuals from chestnut to chocolate brown . among the most threatened waterfowl in north america the entire dusky canada goose population nests in the copper river delta of southeastern alaska and winters in the willamette valley of western oregon 
goose	aerial surveys conducted in july by the usfws indicated that both duck and goose production was highly variable across the surveyed area . goose production on many northern breeding areas also was down from last year but most populations remain healthy overall . pacific flyway goose production was variable across northern breeding areas this year . as in the pacific flyway production among most central flyway goose populations was down from 1999 following a late spring thaw on northern breeding areas . mississippi flyway canada goose populations are expected to be similar to last year with the exception of the southern james bay population which is down considerably 
goose	 clad in my bulky waterfowl parka and muddy neoprene waders i felt out of place going goose hunting in such a aircraft especially so far from civilization . my hunting partners and i quickly went to work placing our mixed spread of canada and snow goose silhouettes and windsock decoys in small groups surrounding shallow pools of seawater left by the falling tide . although polar bears are largely inactive in september during the goose season these top predators will never pass up an easy meal and should always be treated with the utmost respect . my hunting partners broke into a medley of double clucks grunts and moans on their goose calls as a long wavering line of interior canadas winged rapidly in our direction . the lodge was a favorite destination of the legendary outdoor writer jimmy robinson who made annual goose hunting trips there throughout the 1970s . after discussing our hunting plans over a huge breakfast we departed with our guides for the morning goose hunt on the surrounding tundra . after a hearty lunch back at the lodge we had the option of returning to the flats for more goose hunting or walking the surrounding tundra for willow ptarmigan . although i enjoyed the goose hunting and fishing to the fullest the most memorable part of the trip for me was the camaraderie shared with the other guests and staff 
jellyfish	 swimming in jellyfish aurelia aurita ontogenetic scaling of morphology motion and mechanics . the scyphozoan jellyfish aurelia aurita increases its mass by as much as three orders of magnitude in a lifetime and their bodies change from being prolate more tall than wide as juveniles to being oblate more wide than tall as adults . does this change in body shape facilitate higher swimming performance than if these jellyfish maintained the same shape over their ontogeny we addressed this question by measuring the body shape and swimming kinematics of jellyfish spanning nearly three orders of magnitude in body size and by mathematically modeling the hydrodynamics of their swimming . we found that larger jellyfish swam with a lower pulse frequency a disproportionately slower speed and lower propulsive efficiency . however our simulations also suggest that speed and efficiency would be greater if jellyfish maintained a prolate body shape throughout ontogeny 
pelican	jun the wreath and pelican meetings were on june 15 . aug pelican main meeting will be on august 3 . sep pelican and wreath meetings will both be on september 7 . oct pelican meeting is tentatively planned for october 5 . because of his efforts and skill we now have a program that will quickly combine the results of the pelican and wreath decision meetings 
coyote, prairie wolf, brush wolf, Canis latrans	of all the different types of canids wolves and coyotes are the focus of this project . coyotes in the geneva region in illinois have been the focus of a predicament . the coyotes are behaving in typical coyote fashion however people who live in the subdivision in which their territory is centered are having difficulties adjusting . fear for children and pets have caused many people to desire the coyotes removed . the government of geneva has asked for help in determining whether the coyotes pose any sort of threat or nuisance to the people living there 
coyote, prairie wolf, brush wolf, Canis latrans	coyotes are found throughout the state . coyotes prefer a combination of farm land and forest habitat but survive well in the prairie or dense forest areas . the range of an adult female coyote is about six square miles . adult male coyotes may share the territory of two or more females which may overlap the ranges of other males . coyotes normally move two to three miles per day 
lion, king of beasts, Panthera leo	the next morning at the masai mara we woke up even earlier to go find lions . we saw a lion and lioness eating buffalo . there were also hyenas and jackals slowly circling in on the two lions . the lioness did not seem bothered by the other animals presence but the male was cautious of the hyenas . we held our breath that we could see something interesting happen and soon enough the hyenas got a little too close to the lion 
lion, king of beasts, Panthera leo	 it has three medallions around its belly . the medallions consist of a a depicting a crowned shield that has been divided into four quarters . the first and third quarters each exhibit a single lion passant which means that he is walking with his right paw raised . the second and fourth quarters each have two lions passant . it is this label that identifies the medallion as italian and more specifically as representing a member of the tuscan anjou party of guelfs who from medieval times were staunch supporters of the pope 
lion, king of beasts, Panthera leo	the precipitous decline of the steller sea lion as well as harbor and fur seals and seabirds coincides closely with the development of intensive trawl fisheries . 8 million metric tons . about 40 million metric tons of pollock alone have been mined from the eastern bering sea in the last 3 decades . rather than limit the expansion of commercial fisheries to areas outside critical habitat in the years after steller sea lions were listed under the endangered species act nmfs allowed the groundfish trawl fisheries to increase rather than decrease their catch inside sea lion critical habitat areas . the fisheries became compressed into short periods and focused in small areas that overlap significantly with designated critical foraging areas for sea lions 
bison	plains indians depended on the bison to survive . different weapons were used to kill bison including the lance and the bow and arrow . it is not known if the park quartzite cliffs were used by the plains indians to stampede the bison off the cliff . local rumors have persisted for years on the existence of large quantities of bison bones piled at the base of the cliff . that was the only change the park added three bison from the fort niobrara wildlife refuge near valentine nebraska to start the present bison herd . today the blue mounds herd is maintained at more than 100 bison 
assault rifle, assault gun	 this same message also has been delivered via a number of attacks using grenades and assault rifles in other parts of mexico including the u . though cartel enforcers have almost always had ready access to military weapons such as assault rifles los zetas los pelones and the kaibiles are comprised of highly trained special forces soldiers who are able to use these weapons with deadly effectiveness . assault rifles in the hands of untrained thugs are dangerous but if those same rifles are placed in the hands of highly trained special forces soldiers who can operate as a fire team they can be overwhelmingly powerful not only to enemies and other intended targets but also to law enforcement officers who attempt to interfere with their operations . in addition to powerful handguns and assault rifles which are frequently smuggled into mexico from the united states los zetas and los pelones are also known to possess and employ grenades hand grenades and improvised explosive devices and have used them in attacks in several parts of mexico . at times they have mowed down police on the streets with assault rifles or attacked police stations with grenades and other heavy weapons causing considerable collateral damage 
fountain	it presents the trevi fountain as the end of an aqueduct . the fountain is more than a utilitarian terminus . the fountain links its space with other public fountains and with the water source in the surrounding hills and beyond to the clouds in the sky . it is a fountain whose form has evolved over 122 years starting in 1453 with a design by leon batista alberti . with his love of metaphysics salvi sought to celebrate in the fountain the spiritual and functional necessity of water and its relationship to the health and productivity of the city

parachute, chute	drop tests of capsules from a airplane were started to check parachute deployment and spacecraft stability . preliminary drops of the parachute system were made from a nasa helicopter at west point virginia . the purpose of this phase was to demonstrate the adequacy of the mechanical system of deploying the parachutes . spacecraft and operating parachutes were used in these drops and all operational features of the program were worked out . the next phase was the research and development drops offshore of wallops island virginia and the objectives here were as follows to study the stability of the spacecraft during free fall and with parachute support to study the shock input to the spacecraft by parachute deployment and to study and develop retrieving operations 
parachute, chute	mcdonnell subcontracted the parachute landing system for gemini to northrop ventura at an estimated cost of . the parachute landing system was to be used for the first gemini flight . gemini project office had decided in april on using a system one diameter parachute . at a mechanical systems coordination meeting in houston on may however it was decided to add an drogue parachute to the system . fifteen seconds later the main recovery parachute would switch from to suspension followed in five seconds by the initiation of reaction control system propellant dump which would take no longer that 105 seconds . the recovery parachute would be jettisoned shortly after impact 
parachute, chute	northrop ventura successfully completed the first series of 20 drop tests in developing the parachute recovery system for project gemini . the first four drops during the last two weeks of august 1962 used a dummy rendezvous and recovery r and r section with the drogue parachute to determine the rate of descent of the r and r section . subsequent drops tested the main parachute using boilerplate spacecraft no . 5 and 6 were simple weight drops to determine the structural characteristics of the main parachute . 13 the main problem was tucking the edge of the parachute tended to tuck under hindering full inflation . remaining tests in the series demonstrated the structural integrity of the parachute system when deployed at maximum dynamic pressure 
parachute, chute	north american began a series of five drop tests using a boilerplate test vehicle to qualify the parachute recovery system for the test vehicle in the paraglider landing system program . the reoriented paraglider program had begun with two successful tests of the parachute recovery system on may 22 and june 3 . the first boilerplate drop test saw both the main parachute and the boilerplate suffer minor damage but boilerplate drops no . north american considered the objectives of the flight qualification program on the parachute system to have been met despite this failure and requested since the boilerplate vehicle had been damaged beyond repair that the parachute program be considered complete . wind tunnel tests on a spacecraft model isolated the source of trouble and the modified parachute recovery system was successfully tested with a new boilerplate test vehicle on november 12 . results from this test were confirmed by a second drop test on december 3 and the parachute recovery system for the test vehicle was judged and fully qualified 
parachute, chute	a series of live jumps from high altitude to qualify the gemini personnel parachute began . the aneroid was modified and the qualification test program for the personnel parachute was realigned . in place of the remaining 23 live jump tests 10 dummy drops using the complete personnel parachute system including the ballute followed by five live jumps would complete the program . after a free fall to 9200 feet the subject punched the manual override actuating the personnel parachute . this series completed qualification of the personnel parachute and also of the overall gemini escape system 
television, television system	the nielsen media research report from fall 2006 shows that the average american spends 4 hours and 35 minutes watching television per day . per week television viewing adds up to more than 30 hours well beyond a job . television is not necessarily wasted time as people use it to relax and learn . perhaps it is worth considering the benefits that the time you spend watching television could bring . within an hour of television programming you could plan close to a week worth of meals and perhaps even write the grocery list for a weekly shopping trip . stashing weights or exercise bands near the television allows you to readily start an activity when the commercials start . if you have a recording technology you can record television shows and through the commercials . you can finish hours of television shows in less than four hours 
vending machine	caught at the airport on an extended layover and fed up with your lame old cell phone you in luck you soon be able to saunter over to a motorola instantmoto vending machine whip out your credit card and pick yourself up a gleaming new razr . that right motorola plans to start selling its cellphones and accessories in vending machines in over 20 malls and airports around the u . explains arstechnica cingular and verizon are offering service plans in conjunction with the vending machines but consumers can also purchase phones sans plan . first thing to note the vending machine approach stands in stark contrast to say the rich retail experience of the new nokia store . and yes it must be asked who outside of the crazy japanese would actually buy a cell phone from a vending machine 
broccoli	 broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables for example contain antioxidants called glucosinolates . when comparing boiled to steamed broccoli analysis found that steamed broccoli lost little of the vitamin c it contained when raw and contained more glucosinolates than boiled broccoli . this advantage of steaming rather than boiling vegetables was confirmed in another study with spinach and broccoli . 5 minutes of steaming spinach and 15 minutes steaming broccoli . in yet another study cruciferous vegetables including broccoli brussels sprouts and cabbage lost about 90 percent of their glucosinolates when boiled but showed no significant loss when steamed microwaved or . broccoli immersed in water while cooking in a microwave lost 74 to 97 percent of its antioxidants in one study 
broccoli	the squash and carrots mixed in with the potatoes makes the potato mixture a tantalizing golden color that contrasts nicely with the broccoli . 4 large potatoes3 carrots2 celery stalks1 medium onion white or yellow 1 large butternut squash2 large broccoli stalks1 tbsp . wash broccoli and cut into small flowerettes leaving about inch stem on each flower . place the broccoli flowers in a row lengthwise into the top of the potato halves . you may want to place foil over the potatoes to keep the broccoli from drying out

orange	in individual clear glass bowls or a serving dish or pie plate arrange orange slices to cover bottom . place the sugar in a small strainer and sprinkle some of it lightly over the oranges . cover the orange with the strawberries and sprinkle on some sugar . add another layer of orange then one of kiwi . combine the orange juice and vanilla in a small container 
lemon	lemons appeal zest and allby dana jacobi for the american institute for cancer researchwe rarely eat a lemon or use the entire fruit in pies chutneys or as they are for north african dishes . yet we use lemons all the time often several times a day to enliven both savory and sweet dishes sauces dressings and beverages . a lemon is a lemon to americans since the two commercially grown varieties lisbon and eureka are almost indistinguishable . dark yellow meyer lemons in season from november to march are now becoming more available as well . a cross between a lemon and an orange their abundant juice is sweet enough to drink straight . it makes a killer lemon juice has a bright taste . to extract the most juice microwave a lemon for 30 seconds then roll it on the counter top pressing down firmly . using a reamer a lemon yields as much as four tablespoons of juice . lemon peel has two layers the top layer of golden zest rich in the phytochemical called limonen and a spongy underlayer of white pith 
espresso	 after extensive research the hadleys discovered a market for espresso carts on college campuses . they began working closely with matt and ashley mccauley of straight from seattle espresso who have 22 carts in various locations primarily in the baltimore and washington d . what is an espresso cart many people ask perhaps having images of someone pouring drip coffee from behind a modified hot dog cart this is far from the truth . carrellos promises to offer every type of specialty espresso drink imaginable lattes cappuccinos mochas white chocolate mochas frozen blended espresso drinks iced drinks fruit smoothies and specialty teas as well . the job will pay competitive wages and offer employees free espresso drinks anytime on or off shifts 
espresso	 the most recent edition of each gives espresso as the main form and expresso as a variant only . if a dictionary says that espresso is the main spelling it means that in the experience of its editors based on an examination of the language espresso is notably more common . i can defend with extensive written evidence our decision to give espresso as the preferred form . o the spelling espresso is the form used by the copy desks of the new york times gourmet bon appetit the wine spectator the wall st . o in sum though both espresso and expresso are found the former is by far the more common . it is also to be favored on immediate etymological evidence since the italian word from which it is directly borrowed is spelled espresso . the form espresso is clearly preferred by all mainstream sources
