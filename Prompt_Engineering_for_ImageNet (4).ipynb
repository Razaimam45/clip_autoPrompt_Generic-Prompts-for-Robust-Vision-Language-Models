These tweaks improve top_1 by 1.5% on ViT-B/32 over using the default class names. Alec got bored somewhere along the way as gains started to diminish and never finished updating / tweaking the list. He also didn't revisit this with the better performing RN50x16, RN50x64, or any of the ViT models. He thinks it's likely another 0.5% to 1% top_1 could be gained from further work here. It'd be interesting to more rigorously study / understand this.\n",
